# Notas

Project created in one of Alura's React courses to learn about how the library works and component lifecycle. <br />

In it I learned: <br />

- How to create class components within React;
- How to pass information between components;
- How "this" works within Javascript;
- About the life cycle of React components;
- The difference between Statefull and Stateless components.
